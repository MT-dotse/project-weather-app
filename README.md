# Weather App

This week's project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

The people who has made this app is Madelene Trang, Fatima Romero, Jessica Nordahl, Reinis Kalvins, Amanda Tilly and Linnea Isebrink.

## The problem

The problem was working with fetching data from an API. We used vanilla JS for it. Working with branches in GitHub was a new experience for us all, also working with mob programming in a bigger group was a new challenge which we think went well. 
We have another separate branch that Reinis is doing with the more advanced features.
